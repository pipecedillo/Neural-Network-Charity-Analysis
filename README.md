# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

# Purpose

The purpose is to use machine learning and neural networks apllied on a dataset so we can predict wether applicants will be right for Alphabet Soup. 

# Results

Data Preprocessing


What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?

Making sure the target is succesful in the Dataframe will help us realize it has been successfully funded by AlphabetSoup.

What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?

The IS_SUCCESSFUL column

What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?

The EIN and NAME columns doesn't increase the accuracy of the model and can be removed to improve code efficiency.

Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model


How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?

Were you able to achieve the target model performance?

Yes

 What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
 
 The relu activtion at the early layers and sigmoid activation at the latter layers gave the best results
 
 # Summary
 
 The relu and sigmoid activations gave the most accurate results.
